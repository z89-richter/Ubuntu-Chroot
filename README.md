## 👀 Requirements

- Android device with arm64 architecture
- Unlocked bootloader
- Rooted with APatch/KernelSU
  - Magisk is not supported due to **TTY issues starts with version 29**. If using Magisk, use a version below v29.
- [Custom Kernel with these configs enabled (optional)](#kernel-requirements)

<a id="why-this-is-different"></a>
## ❔ Why This Is Different

**Advanced Namespace Isolation**
- Utilizes Linux namespaces (mount, PID, UTS, IPC) for true namespace isolation. Unlike basic chroot setups, this creates separate filesystem mounts, process IDs, hostnames, and IPC spaces - preventing interference between the chroot and Android host.<sup>[<a href="#01-core-namespace-support-required-for-isolation">1</a>]</sup>

  </p>
  </details>

> [!TIP]
>
> **Why Namespaces Matter:**
>
> Traditional chroot only changes the root directory. **Namespaces create isolated environments,** ensuring processes inside the chroot cannot see or affect host system processes, hostnames, or IPC resources.
>
> This allows full Linux services to run without conflicts, security risks, or performance loss.

**Full Hardware Access**
- Complete access to all hardware features of your Android device, including WiFi adapters, ADB, Odin, and more.<sup>[<a href="#02-essential-filesystems-for-hardware-access">2</a>]</sup>

    <br><em>Example tools running with full device access</em>
  </p>
  </details>

**x86_64 Emulation**
- Preconfigured x86_64 emulation enables you to run x86_64 applications and binaries directly on your Android device with full hardware access.<sup>[<a href="#03-running-x86_64-binaries-natively">3</a>]</sup>

    <br><em>Rebooting a phone in Download Mode using x86_64 Odin4 on an ARM64 device</em>
  </p>
  </details>

**"It Just Works" Philosophy**
- No complex terminal commands required. The desktop environment starts automatically when the chroot launches, and most developer tools are preconfigured and ready to use out of the box.

**Containerization Ready**
- When you flash the module, it extracts the Ubuntu rootfs to `/data/local/ubuntu-chroot`, which the backend uses as the installed rootfs.

- Under **Experimental Features** in the WebUI, you can migrate your directory-based chroot to an ext4 sparse image, containerizing your environment into a single `.img` file.
- The Linux environment runs on an ext4 image outside Android partitions, benefiting from improved I/O, caching, and flexibility.
- You can freely shrink, grow, and FSTRIM your sparse image after migration.
- A sparse image can be created at any size (even 1TB) but only consumes real storage as data is written - an efficient storage method for your Linux environment.

**Seamless Desktop Experience**

- A complete Linux desktop experience on Android, capable of running GUI applications smoothly.<sup>[<a href="#04-gui-applications-support">4</a>]</sup>

**Forward Chroot Traffic to Any Network Interface**
- Native WiFi hotspot functionality supporting both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Automatically configures `hostapd` and DHCP services within the chroot environment for instant `localhost` sharing.
- If the Native WiFi hotspot didn't work for you, you still have a separated menu to forward all the chroot traffic to any desired network interface. (e.g., USB Tethering/WiFi Hotspot created using Android userspace)

> **💡 Example**:
>
> Use the GUI running on your phone and project it to another large screen with near-zero latency.

**Incremental OTA Updates**
- Version-tracked incremental updates preserve user data and configurations across upgrades, eliminating the need for full reinstallation.

**Backup and Restore**
- Back up your chroot environment to a compressed archive and restore it later, or transfer it to another device.

**Post-Exec Scripts and "Run on Boot"**
- Define scripts to run automatically when the chroot boots.

> **💡 Example**:
>
> Enable "Run on boot" and reboot your phone - the chroot will automatically start (even while locked), executing your post-exec script so you can host bots, SSH, or background services effortlessly.

**Modern WebUI**
- Access and manage your chroot environment from KernelSU/APatch in-built WebUI.

<a id="installation"></a>
## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ravindu644/ubuntu-chroot/releases)
2. Flash the ZIP file using APatch/KernelSU managers
3. Reboot your device

<a id="usage"></a>
## 🧑‍💻 Get Started

1. Access the chroot control panel using APatch/KernelSU's built-in WebUI
2. On the first installation, you have to set up your user account to access GUI functionality (VNC/RDP):
   - Start the chroot from the WebUI
   - Copy the login command
   - Paste it in Termux and complete the user account setup
   - Return to the WebUI and click "Restart" to apply changes
3. You can now log in as the created user via:
   - **CLI**: Copy the login command and paste it in Termux or any other terminal emulator, including ADB Shell
   - **GUI (VNC)**: Use the [AVNC Android app](https://github.com/gujjwal00/avnc) (recommended for best performance)
   - **GUI (RDP)**: Uncomment the `# start_xrdp` line in the Post-exec Script from the WebUI and restart the chroot

> **Note**: There is currently no perfect RDP app for Android. Please create an issue if you find a better option.

<a id="gui"></a>
## 💻 Access the GUI

Once you've set up your user account following the [Get Started](#usage) section, **the XFCE Desktop Environment will automatically start when you start the chroot from the WebUI - no need to type anything in the terminal !**

The default method to access the GUI is using the VNC protocol with a VNC viewer application.

**Recommended VNC Clients:**

- **Android**: [AVNC](https://github.com/gujjwal00/avnc)
- **Windows**: [TigerVNC](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc)
- **Linux**: [TigerVNC](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc)

### Local Access (Same Device)

**Connection Settings for AVNC (Android):**

- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `5901`
- **Username**: Your chroot user account username
- **Password**: Your chroot user account password

### Remote Access (External Device)

To access the GUI from a different device (e.g., a computer or tablet), **you need to forward the chroot traffic to a network interface**. There are two methods available:

#### Method 1: Built-in Hotspot

This method creates a WiFi hotspot directly from the chroot environment:

1. Open the WebUI and navigate to the **Hotspot Configuration** option
2. Configure your hotspot settings (Upstream, SSID, password, band, channel)
3. Click **Start Hotspot**
4. Connect your external device to the created hotspot
5. Install a VNC client on the external device
6. Use the IP address and port displayed in the console log along with your login credentials to connect

#### Method 2: USB Tethering (Fastest)

If the built-in hotspot doesn't work, or you need the **lowest latency experience**, you can use Android's USB Tethering feature:

1. Open the WebUI and click the **Refresh** button
2. Navigate to **Forward Chroot Traffic** and note the currently available network interfaces
3. Connect your phone to the target device using a USB cable
4. Enable **USB Tethering** on your Android device
5. Return to the WebUI, click **Refresh** again, and navigate to **Forward Chroot Traffic**
6. You should now see a new network interface that wasn't present before
7. Select the new network interface and click **Start Forwarding**
8. Use the IP address and port displayed in the console log along with your login credentials to connect

> [!TIP]
>
> The IP address will be displayed in the WebUI console after starting the hotspot or forwarding.
>
> Look for messages like `Gateway IP` to determine the value for `Host` required for the VNC client. For VNC, the port is always `5901`.

### Advanced: RDP Access

For advanced users who prefer RDP over VNC:

1. Open the WebUI and navigate to **Options** → **Post-exec Script**
2. Remove the comment (`#`) from the `start_xrdp` line
3. Restart the chroot from the WebUI
4. Use an RDP client to connect using the same connection method as VNC (hotspot or USB tethering)

> **Note**: There is currently no perfect RDP app for Android. VNC is recommended for the best experience.

## 🧪 Experimental Features

**Sparse Image Mode Installation**
- Edit the [experimental.conf](./experimental.conf) file before installation:
    - Set `SPARSE_IMAGE=true`
    - Define the image size in GB using `SPARSE_IMAGE_SIZE`

**Converting to Sparse Image**

- You can convert your existing directory-based installation to an isolated ext4 sparse image from the WebUI under **Experimental Features**.

**Downloading Firmware**

- If you want to download and decompress firmware files (useful for installing WIFI firmware without installing random Magisk modules from the internet), run the following command inside the chroot:
  ```bash
  sudo download-firmware
  ```
  This script will install the `linux-firmware` package, decompress all `.zst` firmware archives, and update symlinks to point to the decompressed files. The script creates a marker file to prevent re-running, so it's safe to execute multiple times.

- After downloading the firmware, restart the chroot from the WebUI to apply the changes.

<a id="to-do"></a>
## 📋 To-Do

The following features are currently not planned for implementation by the maintainer, but **Pull Requests are always welcome** if you figure out a way to implement them:

- Audio forwarding in RDP
- Termux-independent GPU acceleration

<a id="known-issues"></a>

## 🐛 Known issues

1. **Snap and Flatpak support**

    - Snap and Flatpak are not native applications like those we install from `.deb`, `.AppImage`, or APT. They are containerized applications running in an isolated environment without any privileged access.

    - To create those isolated, containerized applications, your Android kernel must have support for various filesystems and drivers, as well as kernel patches to enable unprivileged user namespaces.

    - Even if you somehow compiled a custom kernel with all the required features enabled, the functionality is not guaranteed because we are creating an isolated environment within an already isolated environment.

    - Related issue: [#1](https://github.com/ravindu644/Ubuntu-Chroot/issues/4)

2. **`Error: sh: <stdin>[5]: /system/bin/su: No such file or directory` in KernelSU LKM mode/Kernels with KernelSU KProbe Hooks**

    - This is a **known limitation in KernelSU** when using **LKM mode** or **GKI kernels with KProbe hooks** or **non-GKI Kernels without proper 32-bit support hooks**.
    - This occurs because official **KernelSU dropped support for 32-bit applications** starting from versions above v0.9.2, and all KernelSU forks have inherited this limitation.
    - **This causes all 32-bit applications to lose their ability to detect root**, including ADB shell on devices with dual ABI support, Nethunter terminal, Root explorer, etc.
    - **The only fix for this issue is to use a proper kernel with KernelSU manual hooks that support 32-bit applications**, instead of using LKM mode or GKI kernels with KProbe hooks.
    - This error does not originate from this project; it's coming from KernelSU's side.

## 🐳 Running Docker inside Chroot

> [!TIP]
> **Docker is already installed and configured by default,** so you don't need to do anything to install it.

**The quick way to verify if you can run Docker containers is to check if the "Devices Cgroups" are mounted.**

- If you see these logs in the console, then your device has minimal Docker support:

  ```
  [INFO] Setting up minimal cgroups for Docker...
  [INFO] Cgroup devices mounted successfully.
  ```

- Otherwise, there's no way to run Docker inside the phone unless you compile a custom kernel.

**Next,** verify if your `/data` partition is `ext4`.

- **If it is f2fs,** you **MUST** use the migrate feature from "Options -> Experimental Features -> Migrate to Sparse Image" so Docker can properly wire up OverlayFS on top of the ext4 mounted rootfs.

**After verifying your kernel supports Devices Cgroups and resolving any `ext4` filesystem issues, you need to start the Docker daemon using the command below.**

- Run this inside the chroot terminal: `sudo dockerd`

- If the Docker daemon started successfully, it should show something like this:

  ```
  INFO[2025-12-08T16:59:04.981797971Z] Completed buildkit initialization
  INFO[2025-12-08T16:59:05.016738894Z] Daemon has completed initialization
  INFO[2025-12-08T16:59:05.017061663Z] API listen on /var/run/docker.sock
  ```
- If it failed, that means your kernel does not support running Docker even though the "Devices Cgroups" are available.
- In that case, you need to compile a custom kernel with all the required Docker configurations enabled.

**To verify Docker is fully functional,** you can run this command in a new terminal: `docker run -it hello-world`

**To run the Docker daemon whenever the chroot starts, you can modify the "Post-exec Script" from the WebUI by going into the "Options" menu.**

- To enable it, remove the comment from the beginning of the `dockerd > /dev/null 2>&1 &` line, like this:

  <details>
  <summary></summary>

    <p align="center">
      <img src="Screenshots/dockerd.jpg" alt="Docker Daemon" width="650" />
      <br><em>Uncomment dockerd in post-exec</em>
    </p>

  </details>

> [!NOTE]
> **Networking inside Docker**
>
> **For maximum compatibility,** we ship the pre-built rootfs with Docker networking features disabled and **force configured** to use **NAT** instead of creating Docker's own `docker0` network interface.
>
> You can modify this behavior by editing `/etc/docker/daemon.json` if needed.
>
> **Additionally,** every action you run with the `docker run` command will automatically use `docker run --net=host` via the `docker` function in [this script](./Docker/scripts/bashrc.sh), which tells Docker to use the host network for all networking tasks, including internet access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Even if you have a custom kernel with all the necessary configurations enabled,** Docker still won't be able to create the `docker0` interface without flushing the existing iptables filter chains.
>
> **To do this,** first, you need to use `iptables-legacy` and `ip6tables-legacy`.
>
> Run these commands inside Ubuntu:
> ```
> update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
> update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
>```
> **Then,** run these commands to fix the Docker iptables issue:
> ```
> iptables -t filter -F
> ip6tables -t filter -F
>```
>
> **Now,** you can edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to use iptables and run `dockerd` to see if it works. Keep in mind this will only work if your kernel has the necessary kernel configurations enabled.
